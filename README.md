# A\* Search Algorithm Visualizer

## Optimized Open set with a Min Heap

#### p5.js framework was used to visualize the pathfinding process

[Live implementation here](https://astar-visualization.netlify.app/)

The A\* (A-star) searh algorithm is a graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm used often due to its optimizations

It can be considered an extension of the famous Djikstra's Algorithm.

However, A\* achieves better performance by using heuristics to guide the search

Euclidian distance was used as a heuristic in this project.
